# Courtstream Monitor

I watch court streams. Sometimes I want to know if a certain courtroom is streaming during a certain time.

Simply uses yt_dlp's simulate feature to detect if the stream is up, then log and print to console accordingly.

## To Do

1. Put stream URLs in a list to check multiples. Right now just wanting to see if Judge Fleischer is streaming.
2. Activate an alarm sound (.mp3) if a stream is detected online.
